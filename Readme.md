# JavaScript project boilerplate

This project will ease start your `node` and `javascript` application development to the minimum. 
All you need to do is to start your docker container.

## Install project

Clone github repository. Run:

```
docker-compose up -d 
````

You can now open your browser and go to the `http://localhost/` url. The project should be prepared for development. You can even start your debugging with NiM or just go to the docker logs -f and get the url address for devtools debugging.

There is also predefined `Visual Studio Code` configuration, you just need to go to this branch `.vscode-config`.
